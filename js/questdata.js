The project manager has recently heard that there was another project in the company last year that is similar to his second project. What should he do?',
				explanation: 'There are many things the project manager could do. Asking the other project manager for assistance is not the best choice, as the other project manager might not be an experienced mentor. His advice might not be adequate to help this project manager. Waiting to assess the impact on the project is reactive; a project manager should be proactive. Gaining agreement of all the stakeholders on the project scope is also not the best choice. It would be helpful, but does not specifically address the issue in this situation. By contacting the PMO, the project manager can access the knowledge of many project managers, historical information from many projects, and the assistance of someone whose job it is to help. ',

			},
			{	question: 'To obtain support for the project throughout the performing organization, it`s BEST if the project manager:',
				explanation: 'Connecting the project to the sponsor`s objectives might be a good idea, but it does not address the issue of obtaining support throughout the performing organization. Neither a communications management plan nor an overall management plan directly addresses obtaining support for the project. Correlating the need for the project to the organization`s strategic plan is the best way to gain support for the project. ',

			{	question: 'Your management has decided that all orders will be treated as "projects" and that project managers will be used to update orders daily, to resolve issues, and to ensure the customer formally accepts the product within 30 days of completion. Revenue from the individual orders can vary from US $100 to US $150,000. The project manager will not be required to perform planning or provide documentation other than daily status. How would you define this situation?',
				explanation: 'Because orders are numerous and of short duration, this situation is a recurring process, not a project. ',
				answers: [
					{ answer: 'Because each individual order is a "temporary endeavor" each order is a project.' },
					{ answer: 'This is program management since there are multiple projects involved.' },
					{ answer: 'This is a recurring process.', correct: true },
					{ answer: 'Orders incurring revenue over $100,000 would be considered projects and would involve project management.' },
				]
			},
			{	question: 'The previous project manager for your project managed it without much project organization. There is a lack of management control and no clearly defined project deliverables. Which of the following would be the BEST choice for getting your project better organized?',
				explanation: 'Developing lessons learned would help improve subsequent phases, but would do nothing for control or deliverables. Having plans for each work package would help control each phase, but would not control the integration of those phases into a cohesive whole. A description of the product of the project would help, but that would not improve both control and deliverables for each phase. Effective project management requires a life cycle approach to running the project. Adopting a I ife cycle approach is the only answer that covers both control and deliverables. ',
				answers: [
					{ answer: 'Adopt a life cycle approach to the project.', correct: true },
					{ answer: 'Develop lessons learned for each phase.' },
					{ answer: 'Develop specific work plans for each work package.' },
					{ answer: 'Develop a description of the product of the project.' },
				]
			},
			{	question: 'A project team is working on manufacturi ng a new product, but they are having difficulty creating a project charter. What is the BEST description of the real problem?',
				explanation: 'Manufacturing a product is an ongoing process; it is operational work, not project work. Therefore, the manufacturing team would have no reason to create a project charter and would have difficulty doing so if they tried, because of the ongoing nature of the work. If the question referred to a team developing a new product, however, that would qualify as a project. ',

				]
			},
			{	question: 'One of your team members informs you that he does not know which of the many projects he is working on is the most important. Who should determine the priorities between projects in a company?',
				explanation: 'Because the question talks about priorities between projects, this cannot be the role of the project manager, the project management team, or the project team. Determining priorities between projects is a role of the PMO. ',
				answers: [
					{ answer: 'TIle project manager' },
					{ answer: 'The project management team' },

			},
			{	question: 'The difference between a project, program, and portfolio is:',
				explanation: 'A project is a temporary endeavor with a beginning and an end, a program is a group of related projects, and a portfolio is a group of projects and programs related to a specific strategic objective. Remember to use the process of elimination, ruling out any answer that is not completely correct. ',
				answers: [
					{ answer: 'A project is a temporary endeavor with a beginning and an end, a program may include other nonproject work, and a portfolio is all the projects in a given department or division.' },
					{ answer: 'A project is a lengthy endeavor with a beginning and an end, a program combines two or more unrelated projects, and a portfolio combines two or more programs.' },

					{ answer: 'A part of every project activity.' },
				]
			},
			{	question: 'Company procedures require the creation of a lessons learned document. Which of the following is the BEST use oflessons learned?',
				explanation: 'Notice that this question asks about the use of a tool of project management. Many people can learn from a book what a lessons learned document is, but questions like this can more readily be answered if you actually use the tool and know from experience its value. Ask yourself about the other tools of project management. Why are they beneficial? The BEST use of lessons learned is as historical records for future projects. There are other tools that are better for accomplishing the things listed in the other choices. ',
				answers: [
					{ answer: 'Historical records for future projects', correct: true },
					{ answer: 'Planning record for the current project' },

					{ answer: 'The team.' },
					{ answer: 'The sponsor.' },
					{ answer: 'The stakeholders.', correct: true },
				]
			},
			{	question: 'Consideration of ongoing operations and maintenance is crucially important to products of projects. Ongoing operations and maintenance should:',
				explanation: 'Remember the definition of a project: temporary and unique. Operations and maintenance are considered ongoing activities, not temporary. Therefore, such work is not considered a project or part of a project. ',
				answers: [
					{ answer: 'Be included as activities to be performed during project closure.' },
					{ answer: 'Have a separate phase in the project life cycle, because a large portion of life cycle costs is devoted to maintenance and operations.' },

					{ answer: 'Functional manager.' },
					{ answer: 'Sponsor.' },
				]
			},
			{	question: 'Which of the following is NOT an input to the initiating process group?',
				explanation: 'Notice the question asks which is NOT an input to project initiating. Did you read it correctly? Companies should have processes in place for hiring resources, reporting, and managing risks on projects (to name only a few). These are inputs to project initiating, as are company culture and historical WBSs. The project scope statement is an output of project planning.',

					{ answer: 'Project scope statement', correct: true },
				]
			},
			{	question: 'The project sponsor has just signed the project charter. What is the NEXT thing to do?',
				explanation: 'To answer this type of question, look for the choice that occurs closest to the process group you are in. The project charter is created during project initiating. Completing work packages is done during project executing. Validating scope and performing integrated change control are done during project monitoring and controlling. Starting to create management plans is the best choice, as it is part of project planning.',
				answers: [

			{	question: 'The WBS and WBS dictionary are completed. The project team has begun working on identifying risks. The sponsor contacts the project manager, requesting that the responsibility assignment matrix be issued. The project has a budget of US $100,000 and is taking place in three countries using 14 human resources. There is little risk expected for the project, and the project manager has managed many projects similar to this one. What is the NEXT thing to do?',
				explanation: 'Look at the order of planning the project that the team has chosen. Although understanding the experience of the sponsor might sound like a good idea, the sponsor is a stakeholder and understanding the stakeholders is part of stakeholder analysis. That should have occurred before the creation of a WBS. Project scope must be defined before a WBS can be created. Completing risk management and issuing the responsibility assignment matrix cannot be best, as that work does not come next in the process. Other work must be done before risk management can effectively be completed. Creating an activity list comes next after the WBS and WBS dictionary.',
				answers: [
					{ answer: 'Understand the experience of the sponsor on similar projects.' },

			{	question: 'A project manager does not have much time to spend on planning before the mandatory start date arrives. He therefore wants to move through planning as effectively as possible. What advice would you offer?',
				explanation: 'This question is asking which of the choices is the most effective way to move through project planning. Starting the WBS immediately after obtaining a project charter skips the important steps of defining the scope and other activities. High-level assumptions are determined in project initiating. Quality metrics are determined as part of the quality management plan, not after it. The aclivily list is created before the network diagram, so that is the best option.',
				answers: [
					{ answer: 'Make sure you have a signed project charter and then start the WBS.' },
					{ answer: 'Create an activity list before creating a network diagram.', correct: true },
					{ answer: 'Document all the known risks before you document the high-level assumptions.' },

			{	question: 'A project manager gets a call from a team member notifying him that there is a variance between the speed of a system on the project and the desired or planned speed. The project manager is surprised because that performance measurement was not identified in planning. If the project manager then evaluates whether the variance warrants a response, he is in which part of the project management process?',
				explanation: 'Even though the measurement was not identified in planning, the project manager would still have to investigate the variance and determine if it is important. The project manager is in project monitoring and controlling.',

			{	question: 'Which of the following is the MOST appropriate thing to do during the initiating process group?',
				explanation: 'A detailed description of the project deliverables is created during project planning, as part of creating the project scope statement. Root cause analysis occurs during project monitoring and controlling, not initiating. Ensuring all project management processes are complete occurs during project closing.

			{	question: 'The customer has accepted the completed project scope. However, the lessons learned required by the project management office have not been completed. What is the status of the project?',
				explanation: 'Replanning is uncalled for by the situation described. Reaching the planned completion date does not mean the project is necessarily finished. A project is complete when all work, including all project management work, is complete and the product of the project and all project deliverables are accepted. The lessons learned are project management deliverables, and therefore must be completed for the project to be complete.',
				answers: [

			{	question: 'The customer on a project tells the project manager they have run out of money to pay for the project. What should the project manager do FIRST?',
				explanation: 'Every project must be closed, as closure provides benefit to the performing organization. This means simply stopping work is not the best choice. Shifting work and releasing team members do not solve the problemï¿½they just postpone dealing with it. The best thing for the project manager to do is begin the Close Project or Phase process.',

				explanation: 'This question is asking for the most important of the choices. Think about what is involved in integration: project management plan development, project management plan execution, and integrated change control. Updates and product control are parts of project monitoring and controlling, while integration includes more than control. Advancing the careers of team members falls under project executing (the Develop Project Team process).

				explanation: 'Determining who will be on the change control board and determining the reporting structure may have already been done. In any case, these choices are not directly impacted by the number of sponsors who have signed the charter. Having a single project sponsor is not necessary. This situation implies that there are six areas concerned with this project.

			{	question: 'It is the middle of the project when the project manager is informed by her scheduler that the project control limits are secure. That same morning she receives a note from a team member about a problem he is having. The note says, "This activity is driving me crazy, and the manager of the accounting department won`t help me until the activity`s float is in jeopardy." In addition, the project manager has e-mails from a minor stakeholder and 14 e-mails from team members. While she is reading the e-mails, a team member walks into the project manager`s office to tell her a corrective action was implemented by a team member from the project management office, but was not documented. What should the project manager do NEXT?',
				explanation: 'Notice how many situations are thrown at you in this question. It is important to practice reading through questions to discover what is important and what is just background information. In this question, the only thing relevant was the corrective action taken. Once you discover what the primary issue is, look at the choices to find out which is best for addressing that issue. What is the primary issue here? Did you realize the team member`s note is about a non-critical path activity? ("Until the project float is in jeopardy" means there is float and, thus, it is not on the critical path.) So is the issue the noncritical path activity or the documentation? You might disagree with the logic, but in this case the answer is the documentation. In the real world, problems often repeat. Without a record of what was done, there is no opportunity to consider the same solution for future problems. Documentation is critical to projects. Because the change log becomes part of the historical records database, it is best to first record the corrective action taken, then discuss the value of documentation at the next team meeting, and smooth the team member`s issue with the accounting department.',
				answers: [
					{ answer: 'Report the documentation violation to the project management office, evaluate the security of the control limits, and review the e-mailing rules in the communications management plan.' },
					{ answer: 'Clarify the reasoning behind documentation being a problem, get the accounting department to assist the team member, and respond to the minor stakeholder.' },
					{ answer: 'Add the implemented corrective action to the change log, discuss the value of documentation at the next team meeting, and smooth the team member`s issue with the accounting department.', correct: true },

			{	question: 'The client demands changes to the product specification that will add only two weeks to the critical path. Which of the following is the BEST thing for the project manager to do?',
				explanation: 'Do you remember what to do when there is a change? Evaluate first. You wouldn`t take action before getting approval, so compressing the schedule or cutting scope would happen after consulting the sponsor and/or advising the client of the impact of the change. You would not go to the customer before going to your internal management, so advising the client is not the correct thing to do next. The next step is to discuss options with the sponsor.',

				explanation: 'The project manager is asking how to make a change. Such a question cannot be resolved using management by objectives, team relations, or a work breakdown structure. The procedures, forms, sign-offs, and other similar requirements for handling changes should have already been determined in the change management plan.

			{	question: 'The project was going well when all of a sudden there were changes to the project coming from multiple stakeholders. After all the changes were determined, the project manager spent time with all the stakeholders to find out why there were changes and to discover any more. The project work has quieted down when a team member casually mentions to the project manager that he added functionality to a product of the project. "Do not worry:` he says, "I did not impact time, cost, or quality!" What should the project manager do FIRST?',
				explanation: 'Notice that the first paragraph is extraneous. Also notice that the question states that the change has already been made. The project manager`s actions would be different if the change had not been made. The project manager, with the help of others, must determine how a change impacts the project as a whole. Asking the team member how he knows there is no impact on time, cost, or quality is the best answer. This begins the project manager`s analysis of the impacts to the project as a whole by finding out what analysis has already been done. This change minimally involves a change to the scope baseline, and likely other baselines. A change request must ultimately be submitted to integrated change control, but that is not listed as an option.',

The stakeholder supplies a technical review letter from his department proving that the new way to complete the work package will actually be faster than the old way. The project manager has had similar experiences with this department on other projects, and was expecting this to happen on this project. What is the FIRST thing the project manager should do?',
				explanation: 'Complaining about the missed deadline could be done, but it is not proactive. It would be helpful to get to the root cause of why this department always comes up with such ideas or changes after the project begins.

			{	question: 'The engineering department has uncovered a problem with the cost accounting system and has asked the systems department to analyze what is wrong and fix the problem. You are a project manager working with the cost accounting programs on another project. Management has issued a change request to the change control board to add the new work to your project. Your existing project has a cost performance index (CPI) of 1.2 and a schedule performance index (SPI) of 1.3, so you have some room to add work without delaying your existing project or going over budget. However, you cannot see how the new work fits within the project charter for your existing project. After some analysis, you determine that the new work and existing work do not overlap and can be done concurrently. They also require different skill sets. Which of the following is the BEST thing to do?',
				explanation: 'How long did it take you to read this question? Expect long-winded questions on the exam. Take another look at the choices before you continue reading. Did you notice that each of the choices occurs during a different part of the project management process? This question is essentially asking if the new work should be added to the existing project. There may be many business reasons to try to do this, but from a project management perspective, major additions to the project are generally discouraged. In this case, the new work is a self-contained unit of work, has no overlap with the existing work, does not fit within the project charter, and needs a different skill set. Therefore, it is best to make it a new project. The first step to answering this question is to realize that the work should be a separate project. The second step is to look at the choices and see which relates to initiating a new project. Reestimating the project sounds like the best choice only if you did not realize that the new work should be a separate project.

If you selected this choice, be very careful! You can get 10 to 20 questions wrong on the exam simply because you do not see the real problem! The whole discussion of the team member and his actions is a distracter. The real problem in this scenario is not that the team member is being uncooperative. He is asking a question that many team members want to ask in the real world. "How can I tell you how things are going if I do not know what work I am being asked to do?"

Though it is common to have to cut costs and add resources to a project, nothing in the question should lead you to think these will be required in this situation. Customers do not generally approve the project scope (what you are going to do to complete their requirements); instead, they approve the product scope (their requirements).

			{	question: 'When a milestone chart used instead of a bar chart?',
				explanation: 'Both types of charts are used in project planning. Team members need to see details and so they need a bar chart rather than a milestone chart. Risk analysis COULD make use of both charts. A milestone chart is used instead of a bar chart for any situation where you want to report in a less detailed way.

				explanation: 'To answer this question, you must look for a choice that would take longer and cost more. Notice one of the choices says scope was changed, but it was not necessarily added to. If the change was to reduce the scope, it might also have reduced cost. Though it would take time to handle the issue of the need to find a new supplier, the impacted activity might not be on the critical path and thus might not affect time. Purchasing additional equipment definitely adds cost, but not necessarily time. A critical path activity taking longer and requiring more labor hours to complete would negatively affect both time and cost.',

				explanation: 'This question is full of choices that are not correct project management actions. To answer the question, you must first realize that it is never appropriate for a project manager to just cut estimates across the board. You should have created a project estimate based on realistic work package estimates that do not include padding. Then, if costs must be decreased, you can look to cut quality, decrease risk, cut scope, or use cheaper resources (and at the same time closely monitor the impact of changes on the project schedule). One of the worst things a project manager can do is to start a project knowing that the time or cost for the project is unrealistic. Did you notice the choice of adding additional resources? Even though they have low hourly rates, that would add cost. Evaluating, looking for alternatives, and then reporting the impact of the cost cutting to the sponsor is the best action to take.',

				explanation: 'If a problem with quality were to occur again, many people would opt to fix the problem as soon as possible. It is proactive, but some other project constraint(s) must change to accommodate fixing the root cause of the problem. It may not be necessary to allow the schedule to slip, because the project manager might be able to compress the schedule in other areas. Cutting cost does not necessarily cause the schedule to slip, nor would that necessarily fix the problem at hand.

Identify Risks sounds like a good choice; however, identifying quality standards occurs before the Identify Risks process. You may have misread the question and assumed communication planning was complete as well, but notice it only says that communication requirements have been determined. Communications planning still needs to be completed as well. Identify quality standards is the best answer, as planning must be completed on the project.',

			{	question: 'The project manager notices that project activities being completed by one department are all taking slightly longer than planned. To date, none of the activities in the work packages have been on the critical path, nor have they affected the critical chain planning that has occurred. The project manager is bothered by the problem, since four of the next five critical path activities are being completed by this department. After making three calls, the project manager is finally able to converse with the department manager to determine what is going on. The conversation is slow, because both speak different native languages and they are trying to converse in French, a shared language. To make communication easier, the project manager frequently asks the department manager to repeat back what has been said. The department manager communicates that his staff is following a company policy that requires two levels of testing. During the conversation, the department manager also makes a comment that leads the project manager to believe that the policy may include excessive work. This is the fourth time the project manager has heard such a comment. What is the BEST thing to do?',
				explanation: 'Changing the communications management plan may not be needed on the project and it does not deal with the problem at hand, the policy that is slowing things down. Confirming the department managerâs opinion with someone else in the department is not the best choice, as the project manager already has heard the opinion on many other occasions. It is already confirmed. Determining whether upcoming activities should be reestimated is just being reactive. A good project manager will find the root cause and deal with that, even if it means attempting to improve the companyâs policies and processes. Yes, recommending improvement of the policy is the best answer. This is continuous improvement. Because there are several activities affected by the policy, it would best serve the project to get to the root cause of the problem and solve it.',

Which of the following is the BEST thing for the project manager to do FIRST?',
				explanation: 'Although all of these choices are correct things to do, the question asks what to do first. What is the most immediate problem? Getting the instructions translated by a more experienced party could be done, but it does not address the immediate concern of the footings that have already been poured according to the poorly translated instructions. Asking the team to look for other translation issues is an excellent idea. However, it does not address the immediate problem. Informing the sponsor is also not taking action to solve the problem. Isnât it most urgent to find out whether the concrete footings meet your project requirements? Are they adequate? Only the option of looking for quality impacts of the poor translation will help you determine that.',

What is the BEST thing for him to do?',
				explanation: 'Notice that this question asks what the team member should do. It is important for the project manager to understand the team memberâs role and possibly even instruct team members on how to work on projects and what is expected of them. Providing the project manager with his schedule, including the information in a report, and requesting that the issue be added to the issue log have one thing in common. They involve the team member asking the project manager to do something. In reality, it may very well be the team member who will come up with a solution (such as decreasing the scope of the activity, fast tracking, or specific suggestions about changes to predecessor activities). Therefore, recommending preventive action is the best choice for the team member. Note that recommended corrective or preventive actions can come from the team or stakeholders in addition to the project manager. ',

			{	question: 'There have been many work packages completed successfully on the project, and the sponsor has made some recommendations for improvements. Hie project is on schedule to meet an aggressive deadline when the successor activity to a critical path activity suffers a major setback. The activity has 14 days of float and is being completed by four people. There are two other team members with the skill set to assist the troubled activity, if needed. <br>The project manager receives a call that three other team members are attempting to be removed from the project because they do not feel the project can be successful. When the project manager pursues this, he discovers that those team members have issues that have not been addressed. Which of the following is the BEST thing to do to improve the project?',
				explanation: 'Sometimes complex problems are caused by not doing simple things. The data in the first paragraph, once you read the choices, is completely extraneous. The troubled activity has float and so does not need immediate attention. It may not be necessary for additional team members to assist the troubled activity, but none of the choices suggest investigating whether the amount of float is enough to cover any delay caused by the trouble. Rather, the choices take you in different directions.<br>Investigating why the schedule is so aggressive should have been done before the project began. Replacing team members does not solve the root cause of the problem. Could there be something the project manager is doing wrong, or could be doing that he is not, that would solve the problem without losing resources? Wouldnât it be more effective to discover the root cause of those team membersâ concerns so the problem does not surface again later? The creation of an issue log will let the troubled team members know their concerns have been heard, are noted, and will be resolved. This might be enough to stop them from leaving and avoid the resultant project delays and confusion if new team members must be added.',

				explanation: 'This is another question with more than one right answer. Would asking for something in writing be the best way to communicate? In this particular situation, asking for the concern to be in writing might alienate the stakeholders. The issue log is where the issue should be listed, but the situation does not say if the project manager knows what the stakeholdersâ concern is. Therefore, using the issue log cannot be the best choice. Why not make a presentation to all the stakeholders regarding the status of the project?

The project manager gets a call from a team member saying the results from the completion of her activityâs predecessor are two days late. Which of the following reasons would BEST describe why this occurred?',
				explanation: 'Since there is no information about the sponsor or his needs in this situation, focusing on his needs cannot be best. The statement that successor activities should have been watched, rather than the predecessors, is not a correct statement. A project manager should watch both predecessor and successor activities. Attendance at the party and the issue at hand (the late results) are not related. Often forgotten in communications management plans are the bosses of team members (functional management in a matrix organization). Including the bosses of team members in communications planning, requirements gathering, risk management, and other areas of project management helps make the project better. In addition, it helps the functional managers manage their resources effectively. If the functional manager of the team member assigned to the predecessor activity had been included in the project planning processes, he would have known when the team member was needed to do work for the project and the impact, if any, of delay. The communications management plan should also have included a method to communicate potential delays. ',

She happens to hear a manager of one of the departments talking about setting up more regular meetings on the project.The BEST thing for the project manager to do would be to FIRST:',
				explanation: 'Many of these choices could be done, but ask yourself, âWhat is the most effective thing to do?â The party may well generate lessons learned, and recording them would certainly be a good idea, but the question asked what to do first. There is a more immediate issue - the manager. Meeting with all the stakeholders could be useful, but there is only one stakeholder, the manager, who definitely has an issue. Besides, a good project manager would be holding regular meetings with the stakeholders already. Making sure the manager has a copy of the communications management plan might be a good idea, as the manager apparently is not communicating with the project manager. However, this would not be enough to ensure the manager does communicate.<br>The manager is, in effect, saying he is not getting the information he needs. His lack of needed information is causing him to suggest more meetings. However, too many meetings are a problem on projects.

				explanation: 'This issue should be over, but since there were so many meetings and arguments about the requirements being removed, it is unlikely the issue will be dropped by the stakeholders.

What could have been done to avoid this problem?',
				explanation: 'The pitch and tone of voice (paralingual communication) is not relevant here, as the project manager could not even hear all that was being said. There were no issues recognized after the conversation, so none could be added to the issue log. This issue is not related to communications requirements, so that choice cannot be best.

				explanation: 'The risk is the loss of data due to a power outage. Purchasing insurance is not related to preventing the problem. It transfers the risk. Creating a reserve fund is acceptance of the risk, and would help address the cost factors after the power failure, but would not reduce the probability or impact of it. Avoiding the hurricane by scheduling the installation at a different time reduces the power outage risk, but could have a large negative impact on the project schedule and so is not the best choice.

On the other hand, the project manager may have so many skills that would benefit the project that his lack of experience with global teams might not be a major problem.<br>The project manager must make sure the sponsor is aware of the gaps in his qualifications, so the sponsor has the correct information on which to base his decision.',
				answers: [
					{ answer: 'Since he has managed many projects and teams, it does not make any difference that the new project involves global virtual teams. He should tell the sponsor he has the relevant experience.' },
					{ answer: 'He should avoid any conversation regarding the types of teams involved so the sponsor does not know he lacks experience in this area.' },
					{ answer: 'The project manager should point out to the sponsor that he has not had experience with global virtual teams, but discuss why he thinks he is a good fit for the project anyway.', correct: true },

			{	question: 'A project manager gathered data to perform earned value calculations on his project. He used the results to report to management that the project is under budget and on schedule. After reporting this information, he discovered the base figures he used in the calculations were incorrect, as they came from an old copy of the project file that had not been updated. What should he do now?',
				explanation: 'Although things may be gloomy, this is not a new development, since the report was based on old data. It is unethical for the project manager not to admit his mistake, or to blame someone else for his error. The ethical thing to do is to acknowledge and take responsibility for the error.',
				answers: [
					{ answer: 'He should contact management to make them aware of the error, give the correct information, and explain how he made the mistake.', correct: true },
					{ answer: 'He should contact management and tell them to expect some changes in the next reporting period, and that things are starting to look gloomy.' },
					{ answer: 'He should use the correct figures to calculate the information when it is time for the next report and ignore the fact that he reported incorrect information.' },

Luckily, the project cost performance index (CPI) is 1.2. What should you do?',
				explanation: 'Putting the payment in an escrow account or burying the cost hides it. Ignoring the payment is not an option.

				explanation: 'Ask yourself, what is the root problem? Your first action would be to find out whether working with family members is a common practice in that country, as there is nothing inherently illegal in this activity. Then, you would review qualifications. You may find it is not necessary to ask the project leader to provide additional names, or to consider using a different project leader.',

After an extensive evaluation, you discover the project is running far behind schedule, and the project will probably take twice the time originally estimated by the previous project manager. However, the sponsor has been told the project is on schedule. What is the BEST course of action?',
				explanation: 'It is not possible to turn the project back to the previous project manager, as the previous project manager may have left the company, or he may be busy with new projects. That is a form of withdrawal. Moving ahead without addressing the situation also withdraws from the problem, and withdrawal is not the best choice. There are two problems described here; the project is behind schedule, and the sponsor does not know it. There seem to be two possible right answers: restructuring the schedule, and reporting the situation to the sponsor. You should work to get the project on schedule. However, looking only at restructuring the schedule excludes other possibilities, such as cutting scope, which might more effectively deal with the schedule problem. You do not know if the project completion date is critical. What if the sponsor would agree to change the due date? The best choice in this situation is to inform the sponsor of the revised completion time estimate, and discuss options.',

			{	question: 'You are halfway through a major network rollout. There are 300 locations in the United States with another 20 in England. A software seller has just released a major software upgrade for some of the equipment being installed. The upgrade would provide the customer with functionality they requested, which was not available at the time the project began. What is the BEST course of action under these circumstances?',
				explanation: 'Professional and social responsibility includes looking after the customers best interests. Therefore, ignoring the newly available upgrade cannot be best. In this case, the schedule and scope are already approved and all changes must go through the integrated change control process. Therefore, implementing the change on any of the sites without following the process is not acceptable. The best option is to inform the customer of the available upgrade and the impacts to the projects timeline and functionality if the upgrade is implemented.',
				answers: [

At a high- level status meeting, you note that another project manager has reported her project on schedule. Looking back on your project over the last few weeks, you remember many deliverables from the other project that arrived late. What should you do?',
				explanation: 'You should confront the situation by discussing it with the other project manager. You can then find out if the other project is really on schedule and thereby confirm or deny your information. Meeting with the program manager or with your boss would be the next step it meeting with the other project manager validates your concern. You might also develop a risk response plan to deal with the risk to your project. First, though, you need to meet with the other project manager regarding those late deliverables.',

Which of the following is the BEST course of action in this situation?',
				explanation: 'This is a common problem on projects. If your estimates are accurate, you are ethically bound to stand by them. Managements only option to cut cost is to support the project manager in looking for alternatives related to all project constraints.',

What should you do under these circumstances?',
				explanation: 'Describing the costs on past projects incurred due to project management processes not being used addresses the real problem by giving the client information they may not have. An alternate choice is to explain that project management and its associated costs are reasons for the companyâs past performance and success. Project management activities are not optional.',

What is the BEST thing to do to ensure that cultural differences do not interfere with the project?',
				explanation: 'Since this is an issue involving everyone, everyone should be involved in the solution. Spending extra time with the team on creating the WBS is generally a good idea, but it does not specifically address cultural issues. The best choice is to ask one person at each team meeting to describe something unique about their culture. This will lead to better understanding among people of different cultures, and help to avoid potential culture-related problems.',

The PMP- certified project manager knows his information would support the accusations, and the other project manager in question is a friend.

The project manager knows the customer does not have the technical understanding to notice the defect. The deliverable meets the contract requirements, but it does not meet the project managerâs quality standard. What should the project manager do in this situation?',
				explanation: 'Issuing the deliverable as it is does not protect the best interests of the customer. Simply noting the issue in lessons learned does not solve the problem. Informing the customer that the deliverable will be late will cause a default of contract.

At the event where the activities are taking place, the three students refuse to participate, claiming the behavior involved is unacceptable in their country and they would be very uncomfortable participating. What should the project manager do?',
				explanation: 'Insisting that the team members participate is forcing them to do something that is unacceptable in their culture. Requesting their removal from the project penalizes the team members for expressing their cultural preferences, which is not a valid reason to remove them. Excluding them from all future team building does not show respect for their culture, and would have a negative impact on the project. Excusing them from playing, and discussing alternative activities for the whole team with which they would be more comfortable is best because it demonstrates respect for cultural differences.',
