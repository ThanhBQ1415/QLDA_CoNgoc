C.	Make only the changes approved by management.
D.	Talk to management before any changes are made. 

1.	Answer A
Explanation There are only two choices related to scheduling: critical path method and precedence diagramming. Precedence diagramming, however, is a diagramming technique that deals with the relationship between activities, not schedule flexibility. The project manager is analyzing the critical path.
2.	Answer C
Explanation No mention is made that the dependency comes from a source outside the project, so this is not an external dependency. Scope dependency is not a defined term. The key word in the question is “requiring.” Since the dependency is required, it could not be discretionary and therefore must be mandatory. The question defines a mandatory dependency.
3.	Answer D
Explanation The bar chart (or Gantt chart) is designed to show a relationship to time. This is best used when demonstrating progress or status as a factor of time.
4.	Answer A
Explanation The beta standard deviation is computed by (P - 0)/6. Therefore, the answer is (18- 12)/6 = 6/6 = 1.
5.	Answer D
Explanation A heuristic is a generally accepted rule. Examples are cost per line of code, cost per square foot of floor space, etc.
6.	Answer C
Explanation Total float and free float are the time an activity can be delayed without impacting the entire project or the next activity. A forward or backward pass refers to a network analysis technique, not waiting time. Waiting time is the correct definition of lag.
7.	Answer B
Explanation The bar chart may show an end date, but it is not used to determine dates. The project charter also may include a required end date, but not a logical determination of how long the project will take. The network diagram takes the activities from the activity list and adds dependencies. The dependencies allow us to look at the various paths through the diagram to determine the longest duration (critical) path. The network diagram is the best answer.
8.	Answer A
Explanation This question tests your knowledge about a number of topics. There can often be more than one critical path, but you might adjust the plan in order to decrease risk and have only one critical path. The network diagram may or may not change when the end date changes, depending on the amount of schedule reserve and the reason for the change to the schedule. You can have negative float if you are behind schedule. The critical path helps prove how long the project will take. This is the only correct statement of the choices given.
9.	Answer C
Explanation A milestone represents the completion of a series of activities or work packages. Therefore, it takes no time of its own. 
10.	Answer C
Explanation An estimate can have a wide range and still be accurate if the item estimated includes identified risks. There is no such thing as a pad in proper project management. An estimate might be inflated, but it is a calculated reserve to account for risks, not arbitrary padding. The standard deviation tells you the amount of uncertainty or risk involved in the estimate for the activity.
11.	Answer D
Explanation The total float of an activity is the length of time the activity can be delayed without delaying the critical path.
12.	Answer B
Explanation Though having three critical paths COULD require more people or cost more, the answer that is definitely and always true is that it increases project risk. Because you need to manage three critical paths, there is more risk that something could happen to delay the project.
13.	Answer C
Explanation Fast tracking affects both time and cost but may not help even out resource usage. Monte Carlo analysis and analysis of life cycle costs do not directly deal with resources. Resource optimization is the only choice that will definitely affect resources.
14.	Answer C
Explanation Both types of charts are used in project planning. Team members need to see details and so they need a bar chart rather than a milestone chart. Risk analysis COULD make use of both charts. A milestone chart is used instead of a bar chart for any situation where you want to report in a less detailed way. Since bar charts can scare people with their complexity and often show too much detail to be worthwhile on a management level, milestone charts are more effective for reporting to management.
15.	Answer C
Explanation Leveling resources generally extends the schedule. Monte Carlo analysis does not directly address the constraints of this situation. To compress the schedule, you could either crash or fast track. However, the situation says that the network diagram cannot change. This eliminates the fast tracking option, leaving crashing the project as the best answer.
16.	Answer C
Explanation This is another question that asks about problem solving. Neither telling the boss nor waiting to see the status next month tries to solve the real problem. It would be inaccurate to report that the project cannot be finished earlier. Only meeting with the team to look for options for compressing the schedule (by crashing or fast tracking) relates to problem solving.
17.	Answer A
Explanation You may or may not need your customers or your boss’s input, but you will definitely need to include an analysis of risk.
18.	Answer B
Explanation By the time this process is taking place, Develop Project Charter, Define Scope, and Sequence Activities would be completed. The process defined in the question is Develop Schedule. 
19.	Answer D
Explanation This question again tests whether you know how to solve problems. Cutting product scope negatively affects the customer, and is therefore not best. A project managers job is to determine options for meeting any end date; therefore, simply telling management the required date cannot be met is not correct. Working overtime is expensive and unnecessary when there are many other choices that could be selected first. Determining options for schedule compression would have the least negative effect on the project.
20.	Answer B
Explanation Time estimates for the activities should be created by the team and should not be added together to create the project estimate. Some activities may take place concurrently; these would be identified in the network diagram.
21.	Answer A
Explanation The question implies a finish-to-finish relationship between activities. The arrow diagramming method does not support that type of relationship. Critical path is not a diagramming method, and operational diagramming method is a made-up term. The precedence diagramming method is most appropriate in this case.
22.	Answer B
Explanation The situation is neither mandatory nor driven by an external source. A heuristic is a general rule that can be used consistently. This situation is a unique occurrence for which a preferred method is being suggested. Therefore, this is a discretionary dependency.
23.	Answer D
Explanation This is an example of a two-stage question you may find on the exam. First you need to draw the network diagram and find the critical path, and then make a decision. The network diagram would be:<br><img src="img/Chapter 02 E23.png"/><br> The critical path is 16 (Start, С, E, H, End). Many people immediately look for the longest duration activity on the project to cut. Here activity D is the longest, at 10 weeks. However, that activity is not on the critical path, and cutting it would not shorten the projects duration. You must change the critical path. In this case, both activity C and activity H are on the critical path. If you have a choice, all things being equal, choose the earlier option. Therefore, activity C is the best answer.
24. Answer C
Explanation Did you notice how difficult this question was to read? Such wording is intentional, to prepare you for interpreting questions on the real exam. Looking at this situation, you see there are three paths through the network as shown in the following table. If the duration of activity B changes from 25 to 37, the activity will take 12 hours longer. As the activity is only on the third path, it will only change the duration of that path from 55 to 55 + 12, or 67 hours. Since the duration of the critical path is 107 hours, the delay with activity B will have no impact on the project timeline or the current critical path.<br><img src="img/Chapter 02 E24.png"/>
25.	Answer D
Explanation The Develop Schedule process includes all work and uses all inputs needed to come up with a finalized, realistic schedule. As part of the Estimate Activity Durations process, reserves are created to cover identified and unknown schedule risks. All the other items are parts of Control Schedule and occur after the Develop Schedule process.
26.	Answer D
Explanation The schedule management plan is the most correct answer. It includes plans for how schedule changes will be managed.
27.	Answer B
Explanation Beta distribution uses weighted averages to compute activity durations.
28.	Answer C
Explanation Sequencing the activities is the same thing as creating a network diagram, so that has already been done. The Validate Scope process is done during project monitoring and controlling, not during project planning. Since a schedule is an input to risk management, risk management comes after the creation of a preliminary schedule, and so that is not the “next thing to do.” Creating the preliminary schedule is next.
29.	Answer D
Explanation The question is really asking, “What is done after the Estimate Activity Durations process?” The work breakdown structure and activity list are done before Estimate Activity Durations. The schedule is not finalized until after schedule compression. Therefore compressing the schedule is done next. 
30.	Answer D
Explanation Notice how this question and the previous one seem very similar. This is intended to prepare you for similar questions on the exam. Estimating activity resources and analogously estimating the schedule should have already been completed. The situation described is within the Develop Schedule process of time management. Control Schedule is the next time management process after Develop Schedule, but the Develop Schedule process is not yet finished. Final approval of the schedule by the stakeholders is needed before one has a project schedule.
31.	Answer A
Explanation Monte Carlo analysis is a modeling, or simulation, technique. Three-point estimating uses three time estimates per activity. One could use data from past projects to come up with the estimate (analogous estimating), but the best answer is parametric estimating because past history is being used to calculate an estimate.
32.	Answer D
Explanation There is no information presented about lag or progress. The activity described has float, because there is a difference between the early start and late start. An activity that has float is probably not on the critical path.
33.	Answer B
Explanation Cutting resources from an activity would not save time, nor would moving resources from the preferential dependencies to the external dependencies. Removing an activity from the project is a possibility, but since the dependencies are preferential and the risk is low, the best choice is to make more activities concurrent, as this would have less impact on the project.
34.	Answer A
Explanation Did you get lost looking at all the numbers presented in this question? Notice that there are no calculations required, simply an understanding of what the problem is. This question describes schedule management, which is a responsibility of the project manager.
35.	Answer D
Explanation Detailed cost estimates have nothing to do with the situation described. Project management plans include more detail than is necessary for the situation described, and may distract from the conversation if used in this situation. Bar charts are most effective for reporting to the team. The best answer is milestone reports, which present the right level of detail for upper management.
36.	Answer C
Explanation The key to this question is the phrase “constant number used each month.” Only leveling has such an effect on the schedule.
37.	Answer C
Explanation Remember that analogous project estimates are considered to be top-down, high-level estimates. Therefore, they are not based on a detailed understanding of what the work will require. The project manager needs more than an analogous (high-level) estimate to determine whether or not the project will meet the schedule. The benefit of an analogous project estimate is that it is managements expectations of how long the project will take. Any differences between the analogous estimate and the detailed bottom-up estimate can be reconciled in the planning processes. 
38. Answer B
Explanation Waiting until all changes are known, and then printing out a new schedule, is a common error many project managers make. Instead, the project manager should be controlling the project throughout its completion. The situation in the question does not provide a reason to believe the schedule baseline must be changed. A project manager must be in control of the project, rather than consulting with management before making any changes. Whenever a large number of changes occur on a project, it is wise to confirm that the business case, as stated in the project charter, is still valid.
